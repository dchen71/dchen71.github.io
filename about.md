My name is Daniel Chen. I have a biology background and an interest in bioinformatics. I am an aspiring software engineer who is interested utilizing my techincal background in bioinformatics and research. When not slowly building up bioinformatics background, I work on mastering other fields including web and machine learning. I am interested in data science and the possibilty of personalized medicine. Programming is an interesting skill set that has broadened my horizons.  

When not being crunched by machines, I slowly build fluency in foreign languages to fulfill my goals of being a polyglot. 

I will mostly be using the blog in order to post general information and programming snippets as reminders for me on how to do things. Hopefully, if you are browsing this blog, you will find it useful.

Feel free to contact me through linkedin if you ever want to talk about anything.
