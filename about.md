I am an aspiring software engineer who is working on developing my programmatic skills. The technologies that I am acquainted wtih and am working on are:
* Java
* Python
* Ruby
* R
* Bioconductor
* MySQL
* PostgreSQL
* Javascript/jQuery
* Ruby on Rails

I am interested in data science and bioinformatics and am slowly working on mastering them. They are quite a bit of a deep field but I am taking it bit by bit.
