I am an aspiring software engineer who is working on developing my programmatic skills. The technologies that I am acquainted wtih and am working on are:

* Java
* Python
* Ruby
* R
* Bioconductor
* MySQL
* PostgreSQL
* Javascript/jQuery
* Ruby on Rails
* CSS/SASS

I am interested in data science and bioinformatics and am slowly working on mastering them. It's quite a deep field so I am taking it bit by bit while learning other technologies to supplement them.
