My name is Daniel Chen. I have a biology background and an interest in bioinformatics. I am an aspiring software engineer who is interested in applying my skills into bioinformatics or research. When not slowly building up bioinfomratics background, I work on mastering other fields including web and machine learning. I am interested in data science  and am slowly working on mastering all the subtle nuances of the field. Programming is an interesting skill set that has broadened my horizons.  

When not being crunched by machines, I slowly build fluency in foreign languages to fulfill my goals of being a polyglot.
