{"name":"Dchen71.GitHub.io","tagline":"","body":"### About\r\nHello, I'm an aspiring software engineer who is testing out the github users pages. I use numerous languages and do not have any favorites as I use them separately for numerous things. I primarily use python day to day and often slowly work on building up the background and knowledge in bioinformatics. When I am not doing that, I use Ruby on Rails, bootstrap, and javascript/jQuery for the odd web page now and then. In addition, I utilize R to better understand and visualize data for analytics and modeling and work towards data science.","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
