title: Thoughts about the Coursera Genomic Data Science Specialization

Coursera started to offer a new specializtion about half a year ago specializing in Genomic Data Science and taught by John Hopkins University. The courses are aimed at anyone with a degree in biology and wanting to supplement their skills with an introuction some of the toolsets to work with genomic data. 

### About the specialization
The type of work that you will be doing varies on the courses. In general, the courses will involve quizzes, maybe  additional programming homework, or course projects. There is a lot of hands on work using the toolsets required for the courses. It is programming heavy so having some background in python or other languages would be helpful. The courses should culminate into a capstone, whenever that is announced. 

### Thoughts on the program
These are my thoughts on the specialization, while finishing up bioconductor and starting statistics next month as well as having a biology background.  

The specialization is still rather new so lots of things are still being changed or updated if you decide to take it later on. As it is aimed towards those with a biology background, those taking the class without the background may find it introduction on biological concepts and significance insufficient. Likewise, as it is relatively programming heavy, those without the knowledge of the languages or programming may struggle in certain courses.  

Anyways, about the courses. The lectures are fine and the lecturers well explain the topics. The courses encompass a width range of topics and tools in working with genomic data. Considering the abundance of next generation sequencing data as well as the drop in cost, it is definitely a good idea to learn more about how to read and analyze the data. That being said, the courses do require a certain knowledge or willingness to learn how to program. It is not required to come into the courses knowing how to use certain languages however, it certainly will lessen the amount of time spent on certain problems. Having basic knowledge on how to use the command line, python, as well as R will help greatly in the courses. 

The downsides to the courses is how new it is. When I was taking some of the courses, some of them did not have TAs yet so if you had problems, it was up to the students in the forums. There is also to a degree, a jump in knowledge between lectures and doing the programming for homework or quizzes. Some of the courses, such as the one about bioconductor, will time extra time because of this. However, if you need help, the forums tends to be a great place and there are bioinformatic discussion boards to look into.

Just some quick thoughts on the bioconductor and statistics course. They overall feel a little bit rushed but they are still useful courses. You go over how to analyze data using specific packages from bioconductor and get a general overview of stats and how to apply it in NGS data. The stats course in particular, does go over a lot of the common analysis techniques so it does help with understanding a lot of the more computationally focused papers. However, it did feel a bit rushed and tended to end every few videos suggesting to go through some of data analysis genomics courses on edX.
