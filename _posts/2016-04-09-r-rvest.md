title: Scraping web data using Rvest
tags: r, rvest

Rvest is a great package that I discovered recently that allows you to easily scrape the web. It's pretty powerful and allows a lot of options that can be seen in the documentation. Just a quick over example on how to use it:
		
		#Load the library
		library(rvest)

		#Scrape the website
		link = html("http://www.website.com")

		#Filter out the website for the elemnents and information desired
		link %>% 
  			html_node("table tr td") %>%
  			html_text()

 The code above would scrape the website supplied. Then it would filter out from those elements, anything that matches in the html code table, tr, td. You can also filter it based on html classes, ids, and attributes. 

 A quick overview on what classes, ids, and attributes are.

 		<div class="cat"></div>
 		<div id="cat"></div>
 		<div options="dog"></div>

 Classes are noted with period in front of the class so in the case above, *.cat*. Ids are noted with the phone symbol in front so it would be *#cat*. Options are a little more tricky but the following with work with rvest: *div[options]* *div[options="dog"]* depending on how specific you want to be.

 Be sure to check out the docs, under the hood you can do a lot more things such as parsing out attributes and more.
