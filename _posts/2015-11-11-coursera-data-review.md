title: Thoughts about the Coursera Data Science Specialization
---

Coursera is one of many MOOCs which offer courses which teaches and ideally trains one to become more like a data scientist. Although I have not yet done the capstone, I will share my thoughts on the courses for those of you on the fence about the program. 

### About the specialization
The courses, like any other MOOCs out there, are a series of video lectures followed by homework or quizzes. The programming language that will be used will be R. The courses will cover basic R functionality, statistical functions, as well as machine learning. In between, you will clean up and process data as well as do some statistics. In the final course before the capstone, you will leverage your new skills in developing a data product through shiny and create a presentation about it. It also emphasizes reproducibility, which is important in numerous fields including science. The capstone is only available if you completed all the courses verified.

#### Examples of what you will learn to do

### Thoughts on the program
Overall, the specialization is well balanced. It teaches how to use R, statistics, and machine learning. It's a good entryway into going depending on what you want to do with this knowledge. The statistics courses are about the same as elementary statistics courses in college or university, albeit using R instead of calculators to solve everything. The machine learning courses focused more on certain machine learning models although did talk about a lot of the popular models including CART and clustering.

### Suggestions for after completing the courses
**Kaggle(https://www.kaggle.com)**
Kaggle hosts a lot of machine learning competitions which you can compete in for fame, potential career, or prizes. The data sets tend to be huge and will challenge you. If lost, start off on the *Titantic: Machine Learning from Diaster* as there are tutorials for R, Python, and even Excel.
**Analytic Edge**
Analytic Edge is a MOOC offered through edX(https://www.edx.org). This course goes through case studies with the various machine learning model and has the homework based on the model used per lesson. The courses emphasize techniques to check for overfitting with each model. In addition, there is a required course project through Kaggle in which you will do some machine learning.
